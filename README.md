# A passionate web developer from Bangladesh.


### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is Abrar Hussen Zahed. My good name is Zahed. Learning to code was my hobby though. But eventually, it has turned into my profession as well. I have been working as a front-end dev for a couple of years and learning new stuff simultaneously. Because of being a self-learner, I like to take on new challenges in terms of technology to uplift my level.

Skills:  HTML / CSS / SASS /  BOOTSTRAP / TAILWIND / MATERIALIZE / JS / VUE JS / NUXT JS / REACT / NEXT / WORDPRESS / FIGMA / XD
